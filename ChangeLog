2005-12-03  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* I'm switching EoC development to bzr and using commit messages
	instead of a Changelog. This is the last ChangeLog entry.

2005-12-03  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* enemies-of-carlotta.1: Changed - to \- since that is more
	correct. Added the missing word "pipe" in the description
	of --moderate. Added note about + vs - in the Postfix regexp
	example. Documented --show-lists.
	
	* eoc.py: Don't append a footer if the message is base64 encoded.

2005-04-16  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* templates/*: Changed content dispositions from attachment to
	  inline so that they are shown by default in mailers.

2005-04-16  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* templates/bounce-owner-notification, templates/bounce-warning,
	  templates/setlist-confirm: Say "attached" instead of "appended"
	  or "below".

2005-04-16  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py: nice_7bit: Don't treat white space characters as
          requiring MIME encoding.

2005-04-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 1.1.5.

2005-04-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py, templates/help*: Use "EoC" instead of "Enemies of
        Carlotta" so as not to scare off users who don't get the movie
        reference. Did not change filenames, since those are only
        visible to the listmaster and the listmaster presumably can read
        the home page.

2005-04-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Cleaning woman now removes groups without subscribers.
	They can happen when we add a subscriber to a list when they are
	there already and were the only member in their group.

2005-04-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py, eocTests.py, enemies-of-carlotta.1: Added option 
	"pristine-headers" to disable header MIME encoding.

2005-04-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * enemies-of-carlotta.1, eoc.py, eocTests.py,
          templates/msg-moderate: Applied patches from Pascal Hakim
          to implement post moderators separately from list owners.
          If there are no moderators, the list owners are also moderators.

2005-04-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py, eocTest.py, enemies-of-carlotta.1: Applied patch from
	Jaakko Niemi to implement a feature to optionally ignore bounces.

2005-04-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py, eocTests.py: Fixes for treating addresses in a
	case in-sensitive manner (but storing in the form that the
	user gave).

2005-04-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Don't log debug() to stderr. Log info() and error() first
	to file, and to stderr only after that. This should avoid problems
	when MTA's buffer for our stderr output fills up.

2005-04-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * templates/sub-owner-notification.fi,
          templates/unsub-owner-notification.fi: Added the missing word
          "tehd√§". Pointed out by Leena Romppainen.

2005-04-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * Makefile: Installation improvements. Added a mandir variable
        and made man1dir, man1dires, and man1dirfr dependent on it. This
        allows the manual dirs to easily be relocated. Also added a
        command variable to allow renaming of the command in bindir.

2004-12-06  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 1.1.4.

2004-12-06  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Introduced locking of individual messages to MessageBox.
	Used this to prevent more than one request for post approval
	processing from happening at the same time. This should fix the
	problem found by Pascal Hakim, where several moderators are so
	fast to reply to a moderation request that the list gets two or
	more copies of the same message.

2004-12-06  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* TODO: Added.

2004-12-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* enemies-of-carlotta.1.es: Updated Spanish manual page from
	Ricardo Javier Cardenes.

2004-12-04  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* README.CVS: Wrote.

2004-11-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * Making release version 1.1.3.

2004-11-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py: If email.Header module is missing, then work as otherwise,
        but don't MIME encode headers. This should restore the ability to
        run on Python 2.1 and 2.2.
        
        * README: Noted.

2004-11-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py: --show-lists now alphabetizes the output.

2004-11-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * templates/bounce-probe*, templates/sub-already*,
          templates/unsub-already*: Unused, removed.

2004-11-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py: Added the beginnings of a plugin feature. The only hook
        for now is "send_mail_to_subscribers_hook" which allows the plugin
        to manipulate the mail before it is sent to the subscribers.
        
        * eoc.py: Added --no-act option to make testing easier.
        
        * enemies-of-carlotta.1: Documented the plugins.

2004-11-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py: Made it so that an empty template means the mail is not
        sent at all. This can be used to prevent, say, "please wait for
        moderation" messages from being sent on a per-list basis.
        
        * enemies-of-carlotta.1: Documented this.

2004-11-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py: Added --version option.

2004-11-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py: Allow setting of more list options with --create or
        --edit: added new options --language, --mail-on-forced-unsubscribe,
        --mail-on-subscription-changes.
        
        * enemies-of-carlotta.1: Documented them.

2004-11-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py: Added command line options --get and --set.
        
        * enemies-of-carlotta.1: Documented them.
        
2004-11-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eocTests.py: Added a test to check that the headers of sent
        mails are only 7-bit ASCII characters (tab, newline, carriage
        return, plus 32-126).
        
        * eoc.py: Encode outgoing mails to use only 7-bit characters in
        the headers. This is required for the mails to work correctly
        with MIME compliant mail readers. Note that this change makes
        use of the email.Header module in Python 2.3, so with this change
        the minimum supported Python version is 2.3.
        
        * README: Noted Python version requirement change.

2004-09-18  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 1.1.2.

2004-09-18  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * enemies-of-carlotta.1.es: Added manual page translation to
        Spanish by Ivan Juanes. Nobody expectes the Spanish manual
        page.
	
	* Makefile: Install the Spanish manual page.

2004-09-18  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py, templates/*: Implemented suggestion from Magnus Holmgren
	to make attached messages real MIME attachments rather than 
	just inserting the raw message code into a text/plain message.
	Also converted all templates to UTF-8, since that makes it 
	easier to edit them for me. Hopefully nothing broke.

2004-09-18  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: When an EoC exception occurs, print out a sensible
	error message about it rather than letting Python print out
	a stack trace.

2004-09-18  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py, eocTests.py, enemies-of-carlotta.1: Added support for
        adding headers to and removing headers from mails sent to the
        list. See the files headers-to-add and headers-to-remove in the
        list directories.

2004-09-12  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py, eocTest.py: Added support for $listdir/headers-to-add
	(but it still needs to be documented).

2004-09-03  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py, eocTest.py: Some refactoring and new unit tests.

2004-08-28  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 1.1.1. This release is dedicated to Jaakko
	Niemi, the winner of the bug finding competition for 1.1.0.

2004-08-28  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* enemies-of-carlotta.1: Added note about the "templates" directory
	in the list specific directory using a patch sent by Jaakko Niemi,
	who thereby won the bug finding competition.

2004-08-26  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: in AddressParser, return the canonical name of the list,
	instead of converting it to lower case. Also, when opening a list,
	open using the canonical name rather than one converted to lower
	case or derived from the incoming mail address. Thanks to Jaakko
	Niemi for pointing these problems out.
	
	* eocTests.py: Improved testing cases when the name of a list is
	not all lower case.

2004-08-26  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py, eocTests.py: Bugfix for bug found by Jaakko Niemi.
	If the list has been created with a name containing upper case,
	--is-list won't work. Fixed by making AddressParser convert
	all list names it gets to lower case.

	* Makefile: Bugfix for bug found by Jaakko Niemi. Used bashism in
	the install target, which made install not work under dash and
	other shells. Fixed by manually expanding a {foo,bar} construct.
	
	* Makefile: Bugfix for bug found by Jaakko Niemi. qmqp.py was not
	installed by "make install". Oops.

2004-08-24  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Changed md5sum_as_hex to use .hexdigest() instead of
	doing the hex conversion manually. I should read more manuals.
	Thanks to Magnus Holmgren for pointing this out.

2004-08-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 1.1.0.

2004-07-25  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py: Added a realname for the From line in message
        templates. This is meant to avoid some spam filters.

2004-07-25  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py, eocTests.py: Refactoring. Moved address parsing into
        its own class, for simplicity, and started work on making EoC
        specific exceptions be more user friendly as far as error
        messages are concerned.

2004-07-25  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eocTests.py: Added some test cases for recipient address
          parsing.

2004-07-09  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * eoc.py: Refactoring changes to make code nicer. No functional
        changes.

2004-07-09  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Removed a bunch of documentation from the beginning of
	the file. It was never finished, and was partly outdated, and it's
	better put in README anyway, when I have a moment to flesh it out.
	
	* eocTests.py: Simplified (shortened) the implementation of a test
	case in the anticipation of adding more cases to it.

2004-03-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * templates/*.sv: Added Swedish translation from Magnus Holmgren.

2004-02-21  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Use the rejection address for subscription and posting
	moderation requests. This is to make it easier for mutt users
	to mail to the rejection address: they can just answer "no"
	to the question about using Reply-To. Thanks to Antti-Juhani
	Kaijanaho for pointing this out.

2004-02-21  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* enemies-of-carlotta.1: Updated.
	
	* eoc.py: Added --sender and --recipient options on suggestion
	from Tommi Virtanen.

2004-02-21  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Convert addresses to lower case so that random
	capitalizations (especially in domain names) don't break things
	for us.

2004-02-21  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Added some safeguards against subscribing addresses
	without @ characters.

2004-02-21  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Catch GetoptError exception and print an error message.
	This is nicer for the user than the stack trace.

2004-02-21  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* qmqp.py: Added QMQP sending module by Jaakko Niemi. Thanks!
	Did change encoding of single recipient so that Postfix will
	accept that.
	
	* eoc.py: Changes to allow use of QMQP. Also, when logging a
	sent mail, do it with a bit more white space so that it will be
	easier to read the log file.

2004-01-13  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* enemies-of-carlotta.1: Removed the word "also" from the
	description of where subscription confirmation requests are
	sent, since it was incorrect. Also added a suggestion that
	--cleaning-woman should be run once per hour.
	
	* Makefile: Added patch from Jacek Konieczny to add DESTDIR
	support.

2003-09-07  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 1.0.3.

2003-09-07  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* enemies-of-carlotta.1: Removed erroneous quotation marks in
	the Qmail section. Added section documenting all mail commands.

2003-09-06  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Bugfix. log_file() was broken in that it would replace
	an already open output stream with one writing to /dev/null.
	Fixed that. Also, not writing to /dev/null anymore in cases where
	DOTDIR doesn't exist, but rather using a special purpose output
	file stream simulator DevNull.

2003-07-16  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py, eocTests.py, enemies-of-carlotta.1: Added command line
	option --post for bypassing moderation status on a list.

2003-07-14  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 1.0.2.

2003-06-20  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* enemies-of-carlotta.1: Fixed the example for creating a
	mailing list.
	
	* eoc.py: Added option --show-lists, from Stefan (who gave no
	last name).

2003-05-11  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 1.0.1.

2003-05-11  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Bounce handling was totally broken, because the
	final step was missing. What used to happen: EoC sends mail to
	subscribers, it bounces, states goes from "ok" to "bounced";
	after one week, cleaning woman sends probe; two weeks after
	bounce, cleaning woman unsubscribes. What was missing: if probe
	bounces, state is set to "probebounced", and cleaning woman only
	unsubscribes if state is "probebounced", otherwise it resets
	state to "ok". This was quite an embarrassing bug.

2003-05-11  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: --help option implemented.
	* eoc.py: Don't create dotdir if only --help is given.
	* eoc.py: If dotdir exists, but secret doesn't, create secret
	instead of crashing.

2003-04-13  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 1.0.
	
	* There have been no changes. I had planned to improve
	documentation, but the release party is tomorrow and, well,
	I want this out. Anyway, I'll have a better idea what to put
	into the manual if people first send me hate mail about the
	difficult parts.

2003-04-13  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 0.23.

2003-04-13  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: -reject now actually removes the rejected message. Oops.

2003-04-13  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Changed mail command -setlist to welcome new subscribers
	and say goodbye to old ones.

	* eoc.py: Added mail command -setlistsilently, which is the same
	as -setlist, but preserves the old behavior of not welcoming or
	saying goodbye.
	
	* templates/setlist-confirm{,.es,.fi,.fr}: Removed the sentence
	saying that new subscribers won't be welcomed. Hopefully I
	recognized it correctly in French and Spanish.

2003-03-22  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release 0.22.

2003-03-22  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Messages sent by EoC that used to have an empty SMTP
	sender (which made them look like bounce messages) now have
	foo-ignore@example (for the foo@example.com list). This avoids
	having to deal with different ways to specify an empty sender
	and is also more correct since the messages sent by EoC aren't
	really bounces.

2003-03-16  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Making release version 0.21.

2003-03-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* templates/*.es and *.fr: Translations to Spanish for new
	templates by Ricardo Javier Cardenes, and to French by Pierre
	Machard.

2003-03-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Implemented -setlist command to allow list owner to
	change the whole subscriber list as one operation. This should
	be useful for people maintaining the list of subscriber outside
	EoC's control, e.g., when the list is generated from a database.
	
	* templates/setlist-badlist, templates/setlist-confirm,
	templates/setlist-done, templates/setlist-sorry: New templates
	for this feature. Need to be translated.
	
	* templates/setlist-*.fi: Translated to Finnish.

2003-03-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: If the sender of a subscription or unsubscription
	request is a list owner, the list owners are requested to do
	the confirmation, instead of the address being subscribed.
	The welcome or goodbye message is still sent to the subscriber.

2003-03-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: When someone is sending mail to a moderated list,
	inform them that their message has been sent to the list owners
	for approval.
	
	* templates/msg-wait: New mail template. Needs translations.
	
	* templates/msg-wait.fi: Translated to Finnish.

2003-03-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* enemies-of-carlotta.1.fr: Proofread translation by G√©rard
	Delafond, sent by Pierre Machard.

2003-03-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* templates/footer.es, templates/footer.es: Translations re-worded
	so that they only use 7 bit ASCII characters, to avoid charset
	problems. Thanks to Pierre Machard and Ricardo Javier Cardenes.

2003-03-14  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: When subscribing to a list with subscription moderation,
	the would-be subscriber is notified that a request has been sent
	to the moderator and that they need to be patient.
	
    	* eocTests.py: Related changes.

	* templates/sub-wait: New mail template for this. Needs
	translation.
	
	* templates/sub-wait.fi: Translated sub-wait to Finnish.
	
	* templates/*.fr: Added Content-type headers to all templates.
	
2003-03-14  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* templates/footer.fi: Reworded to use only us-ascii letters.

2003-03-08  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* BENCHMARKS, eoc-benchmark, eoc-benchmark-procmailrc: Added.

2003-02-25  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* enemies-of-carlotta.1.fr, templates/*.fr: Added translations
	sent by Pierre Machard (pierre at machard.org).
	
	* templates/*.es: Added translations sent by Ricardo Javier
	Cardenes (ricardo at conysis.com).
	
	* Making release 0.20.

2003-02-22  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

    	* eoc.py: Added configuration option "language".
	
	* templates/*.fi: Translated templates to Finnish so that I can
	test the "language" configuration option.

	* enemies-of-carlotta.1: Added "CONFIGURATION" section.
	
	* Making relase 0.19.

2003-02-18  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Use os.path.isfile instead of os.path.exists to see
	whether a MessageBox contains a file.

2003-02-16  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Command line options --edit, --subscribe, --unsubscribe,
	and --list now allow the list name to be abbreviated by
	leaving out the domain (and @). I don't want to allow shorter
	abbreviations to make it less likely that you specify the wrong
	list by mistake.
	
	* eoc.py: When a bouncing address is restored to "ok" status,
	its bounce message is removed from the bounce-box.
	
	* eoc.py: Added configuration options mail-on-forced-unsubscribe
	and mail-on-subscription-changes.
	
	* Making release 0.18.

2003-02-09  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Applied patch from Ricardo Javier Cardenes
	<ricardo@conysis.com> to implement posting option "auto", which
	will let messages from subscribers automatically into the list
	and send others to the moderator.
	
	* Making release 0.17.

2003-01-12  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

    	* Releasing version 0.16.1.

	* eoc.py: Bounce message quoting had a stupid bug: it didn't 
	add newlines.

2003-01-11  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

    	* Releasing version 0.16.

    	* eoc.py: First bounce message is now saved (up to 4096 bytes) and
	quoted in the bounce-warning message.

    	* eoc.py: When state changes to bounce, it is noted in the log file.

	* eoc.py, eocTests.py: Addresses now can't be added twice to
	the list.

	* eoc.py: Added missing exception MissingTemplate.
	
2002-12-11  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Releasing version 0.15.

2002-12-08  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Added --moderate option for asking a message to be
	moderated. To be used for spam filtering, at least.

2002-12-08  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eocTests.py: Set the quiet flag, so that "make check" doesn't
	output debuggning messages.

2002-12-08  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Also look in the list's template directory for templates.
	This is useful for doing list specific customizations, e.g., for
	the footer.

	* enemies-of-carlotta: Wrote startup wrapper for faster startup.

	into the share directory, plus compile eoc.py on installtion.¬ß

2002-11-04  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Cleaning woman now logs addresses it removes and sends
	a final goodbye message when it does.

    	* templates/bounce-probe: Fixed spelling mistake.

	* templates/bounce-goodbye: Wrote.

2002-10-26  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* A bounce splits a group with many addresses. If the original group
	contained addresses in several domains, it is split into groups 
	according to domains, otherwise into groups with single addresses.

	* --cleaning-woman joins groups that haven't bounced for a week
	into bigger groups.

2002-10-26  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* eoc.py: Bug fix. When there were over ten subscribers, the
	generation of group ids was wrong, since a list of group ids
	was sorted lexically, instead of numerically.
	
	* eocTests.py: Added test case to test this.

2002-10-26  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Makefile: added $(prefix), installation of templates.
	
	* fix-config: directory is given on the command line.
	
	* eoc.py: Added some more debugging output.

2002-09-22  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Starting upstream ChangeLog. Sooner or later someone else is
	  going to be maintaining the Debian packaging stuff, and then
	  it's sensible to keep things separate.

    	* Removed debian/*. I can live without them myself, and I don't
	  want to maintain them when there are perfectly too Debian
	  developers available. :)

    	* Makefile: Added an install target. Very simplistic.
	
	* COPYING, README: Added these files. This is beginning to seem
	  like something that can be shown in public.

    	* Releasing version 0.11.
