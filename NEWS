NEWS file for Enemies of Carlotta, a mailing list manager

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.2.5 to version 1.2.6:

    * When listname-setlistsilently@example.org is mailed from an address
      which isn't the admin, EoC died. Now fixed. Bug found and patched by
      Dominic Hargreaves.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.2.4 to version 1.2.5:

    * The change in 1.2.3 used the wrong log printing function, this
      release uses the right one.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.2.3 to version 1.2.4:

    * A fix to CVE-2006-5875, a security problem where EoC did not quote
      shell command line arguments properly. Thanks to Antti-Juhani
      Kaijanaho for finding the problem.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.2.2 to version 1.2.3:

    * When there is a problem with MIME header encodings, don't kill EoC,
      just print a warning.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.2.1 to version 1.2.2:

    * Manual page: documents the values to the --posting option, and has
      instructions for Courier-MTA users.
    
    * When someone is told to wait for moderation, the message now contains
      a few words of explanation that it might have happened due to spam.
      
    * A German translation courtesy of Johannes Berg.
    
    * Fixes to mail template headers (missing MIME-Type added, typos in
      Content-Type headers).
      
    * Bug fixes to avoid problems when mail headers are wrong (and encoding
      them correctly fails), or when mail headers contain colons, or when
      there's problems sending mail. Also, List-* headers are removed from
      incoming e-mails.
      
    * CRLF line endings in incoming messages are converted to LF.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.2 to version 1.2.1:

    * Bugfix: Checking for base64 encodings now works.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.1.5 to version 1.2:

    * When the list manager sends a mail with an attached message (e.g.,
      a bounce), they are marked as "Content-disposition: inline" so that
      they are shown by default (by sensible mail user agents).
      
    * A footer is not appended to messages that are base64 encoded.
    
    * Updated translations for templates and manual pages.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.1.4 to version 1.1.5:

    * Debug logs no longer go to stderr, just to the log file. This should
      prevent sudden deaths from MTA buffers becoming full.
      
    * Bugs about treating addresses in case-insensitive manners fixed.
    
    * Lists can now be configured to ignore bounces. (By Jaakko Niemi.)
    
    * Moderators for posting can be separate from list owners. (By Pascal
      Hakim.)
      
    * Header MIME encoding can be disabled per list.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.1.3 to version 1.1.4:

    * Fixed race condition when multiple moderators approve or reject the
      same message at the same time. This could result in the message being
      sent multiple times.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.1.2 to version 1.1.3:

    * Mails sent by EoC now get their headers MIME encoded (if the version
      of Python in use has the email.Header module).

    * A bunch of new command line options: --get, --set, --language,
      --mail-on-forced-unsubscribe, --mail-on-subscription-changes,
      --version
      
    * Making an empty template file prevents the corresponding mail from
      being sent at all. This can be used, for example, to prevent
      "please wait for moderation" mails.
      
    * The beginnings of a plugin architecture, where plugins can modify
      EoC's operation or the mails it sends. There is only one supported
      hook at the moment, though, but more will be added as needed.
      
    * --show-lists now shows lists in alphabetical order.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.1.1 to version 1.1.2:

    * This is still a DEVELOPMENT release. There have been many changes
      and the documentation and translations are probably out of date.
      There may be bugs lurking as well.
      
    * Headers of messages sent to the list can be manipulated in simple
      ways: some headers can be removed and others added.
      
    * Error messages are now user-friendlier than Python's stack traces.
    
    * When EoC attaches a message to something it sends to a user, it
      does so by making it a proper MIME attachment.
      
    * Message templates are now in UTF-8.
    
    * Manual page in Spanish.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.1.0 to version 1.1.1:

    * This is still a DEVELOPMENT release. There have been many changes
      and the documentation and translations are probably out of date.
      There may be bugs lurking as well.
      
    * Manual page mentions the "templates" sub-directory of the list specific
      directory.
      
    * QMQP implementation is now installed by "make install".
    
    * Bashism in the Makefile have been removed.
    
    * Bugs regarding lists with names that are not all lower case have
      been fixed.

    * This release is dedicated to Jaakko Niemi who found most bugs in 1.1.0.

Significant user-visible changes from version 1.0.3 to version 1.1.0:

    * This is a DEVELOPMENT release. There have been many changes and the
      documentation and translations are probably out of date. There may be
      bugs lurking as well.
      
    * QMQP support from Jaakko Niemi.
    
    * Command line syntax errors result in an error message rather than 
      a stack trace.

    * Upper and lower case are no longer treated as being different characters
      in e-mail addresses.
      
    * New options --sender and --recipient.
    
    * Subscription and posting moderation requests now use the rejection
      address to make life easier for mutt users.
      
    * Swedish translation.
    
    * Mails sent by EoC now have a "real name" in the From header, to lessen
      the chance they are caught by spam filters.

Significant changes from version 1.0.2 to version 1.0.3:

    * Added option --post, to bypass moderation.
    
    * The manual page now documents all mail command addresses.
    
    * Bug fix: Qmail section in the manual page had extra quotation marks.
    They have been removed.
    
    * Bug fix: Log file didn't get more than the first message of each
    run. Now fixed so that it gets all messages. (Stderr got everything
    even before, though.)

Significant changes from version 1.0.1 to version 1.0.2:

    * Manual page fix: the example for creating a new list now actually
    works.
    
    * Added option --show-lists, to list all lists.

Significant changes from version 1.0 to version 1.0.1:

    * Bug fixes only.
    
    * --help option implemented.
    
    * --create: If ~/.enemies-of-carlotta exists, but a file named
    "secret" inside it doesn't, create the file instead of crashing.
    
    * Bounce handling fixed.
