Hello, 

You are subscribed to the %(list)s mailig list.

Mail sent to you by the mailing list software has bounced at least once
in the past week or so. If this was a temporary error, you can ignore
this warning. However, if your mail continues to bounce, you will
eventually be automatically unsubscribed from the list. Sorry about
the inconvenience.

The first bounce message is attached.

For instructions on using the mailing list manager software, send
mail to %(local)s-help@%(domain)s .

If you have problems, please contact the human owners of the list
at %(local)s-owner@%(domain)s .

Thank you.
