Hello, 

This mail has been sent by the mailing list manager operating the
%(list)s mailing list.

One of the owners of the list (or someone pretending to be one) has asked
for the subscriber list for the list to be changed.  The request mail,
with the new set of describers, is attached.  If you accept the
change, please respond to this mail. Otherwise please just ignore it.

Note that the whole subscriber list will be changed to the list of
addresses below. All old subscriptions will be forgotten, unless they
are also on the new list of subscribers.

For instructions on using the mailing list manager software, send
mail to %(local)s-help@%(domain)s .

If you have problems, please contact the human owners of the list
at %(local)s-owner@%(domain)s .

Thank you.
